Linear Regression,Build a linear regression model to predict the 'All items' index based on the 'Food' and 'Housing' indices.,"```python

```","In this code, we first create a copy of the DataFrame to avoid modifying the original data. We then check for missing values in the 'All items', 'Food', and 'Housing' columns and drop any rows that contain missing values in these columns. Next, we prepare our feature set (X) and target variable (y), ensuring they are converted to float type. We add a constant term to the predictors to account for the intercept in the regression model. Finally, we attempt to fit the linear regression model using statsmodels' OLS function and handle any exceptions that may arise during the fitting process. If the model fitting is successful, we print the summary of the regression results, which includes coefficients, R-squared values, and other statistical metrics."
Logistic Regression,"Create a logistic regression model to classify years with high 'All items, less imputed rent' based on 'Gas' and 'Electricity' expenses.","```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Assuming df is already defined and contains the relevant data
df = df.copy()

# Step 1: Define the target variable
median_value = df['All items, less imputed rent'].median()
df['High Rent'] = (df['All items, less imputed rent'] > median_value).astype(int)

# Step 2: Prepare the features and target variable
X = df[['Gas', 'Electricity']]

print(result.summary())
```","In this analysis, we first defined a binary target variable 'High Rent' based on whether 'All items, less imputed rent' exceeds its median value. We then prepared the feature set consisting of 'Gas' and 'Electricity' expenses. After checking for missing values and converting the data types to float, we added a constant term to the predictor variables. Finally, we fitted a logistic regression model using statsmodels and printed the summary of the model to evaluate its performance. This approach allows us to classify years based on their expenses in relation to the defined threshold for 'All items, less imputed rent'."
Multiple Regression,"Develop a multiple regression model to predict 'All items, less fresh food' using 'Cereals', 'Meats', and 'Beverages'.","```python

If any missing values are found, we print the counts and drop the rows with missing values to ensure our regression analysis is valid. We then define our predictor variables (Cereals, Meats, and Beverages) and the response variable (All items, less fresh food). After converting these variables to float, we add a constant term to the predictors to account for the intercept in the regression model. Finally, we fit the model using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method from the statsmodels library and print the summary of the model, which includes coefficients, R-squared values, and other statistical metrics. If the model fitting fails, we catch the exception and print an error message."
ANOVA,Perform an ANOVA to analyze the difference in 'Food' index across different years.,"```python

print(anova_table)
```","In this code, we first create a copy of the DataFrame to avoid modifying the original data. We then check for missing values in the 'Food' and 'Year' columns and drop any rows that contain missing values. The 'Year' column is converted to a categorical type to ensure it is treated correctly in the ANOVA analysis. We then fit an ANOVA model using the `ols` function from `statsmodels`, specifying 'Food' as the dependent variable and 'Year' as the independent variable. Finally, we generate the ANOVA table using `sm.stats.anova_lm`, which provides the results of the analysis, including the F-statistic and p-values to assess the significance of the differences in the 'Food' index across different years."

```","The code begins by checking for missing values in the dataset and fills them using the forward fill method. The 'Year' column is converted to a datetime format and set as the index of the DataFrame. We then check if there are enough observations for seasonal decomposition, which requires at least 12 data points. The seasonal decomposition is performed to extract the trend, seasonal, and residual components of the 'All items' index. An ARIMA model is fitted to the data, and if the fitting fails, a clear error message is provided. Finally, the model is used to forecast the 'All items' index for the next 5 years, and the forecasted values are printed."
