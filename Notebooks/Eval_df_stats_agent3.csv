Linear Regression,Determine if there is a linear relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score.,"```python

```","In this analysis, we are performing a linear regression to explore the relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score. We first check for missing values and handle them by dropping any rows with missing data. We then define our independent variable (Annual Income) and dependent variable (Spending Score), ensuring they are in float format for the model fitting. A constant term is added to the predictor to account for the intercept in the regression equation. Finally, we fit the model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and print the summary of the regression results, which will provide insights into the relationship between the two variables, including coefficients, R-squared value, and statistical significance."
Logistic Regression,"Predict the likelihood of a customer having a high Spending Score based on their Annual Income, Age, and Work Experience.","```python
import pandas as pd

df = df.copy()

    raise ValueError(""The dataset contains missing values. Please handle them before proceeding."")

# Step 2: Create a binary target variable for high Spending Score
df['High Spending Score'] = (df['Spending Score (1-100)'] >= 50).astype(int)

# Step 3: Define the predictor variables and the target variable
X = df[['Annual Income ($)', 'Age', 'Work Experience']]
y = df['High Spending Score']

# Step 4: Add a constant to the predictor variables
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Step 5: Fit the logistic regression model
try:

    result = model.fit()
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f""Model fitting failed: {e}"")

# Step 6: Output the summary of the model
print(result.summary())
```","The code begins by checking for missing values in the dataset. If any are found, it raises an error to prompt the user to handle them. Next, we create a binary target variable, 'High Spending Score', which indicates whether a customer's Spending Score is high (50 or above). We then select the predictor variables: Annual Income, Age, and Work Experience, and add a constant term to the predictors for the logistic regression model. Finally, we fit the logistic regression model using the `Logit` function from the statsmodels library and handle any potential errors during the fitting process. The summary of the model is printed to provide insights into the relationship between the predictors and the likelihood of having a high Spending Score."
Multiple Regression,"Analyze how Annual Income, Age, and Family Size together influence the Spending Score.","```python

Next, it defines the independent variables (Annual Income, Age, and Family Size) and the dependent variable (Spending Score). The independent variables are converted to float type, and a constant term is added to the model to account for the intercept. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model is then fitted using statsmodels. If the model fitting fails, an error message is printed. Finally, the summary of the regression model is displayed, which includes coefficients, R-squared values, and other statistical metrics that help in understanding the influence of the independent variables on the Spending Score."
ANOVA,Test if the mean Spending Score differs significantly across different Professions.,"```python
