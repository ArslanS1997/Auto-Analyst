Linear Regression,Determine if there is a linear relationship between Malic acid and Alcohol content.,"```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Assuming df is already defined and contains the dataset
df = df.copy()

# Check for missing values
if df[['Malic acid', 'Alcohol']].isnull().any().any():
    raise ValueError(""Missing values found in 'Malic acid' or 'Alcohol' columns."")

# Define independent and dependent variables
X = df[['Malic acid']]
y = df['Alcohol']

# Convert to float
X = X.astype(float)

# Add a constant to the model

except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f""Model fitting failed: {e}"")

# Output the summary of the regression
model_summary = model.summary()
print(model_summary)
```","The code begins by checking for missing values in the 'Malic acid' and 'Alcohol' columns. If any are found, it raises an error. We then define our independent variable (X) as 'Malic acid' and our dependent variable (y) as 'Alcohol', converting both to float types. A constant term is added to the predictor to account for the intercept in the regression model. We then attempt to fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model using statsmodels. If the model fitting fails for any reason, a runtime error is raised with a clear message. Finally, the summary of the regression model is printed, which includes coefficients, R-squared values, and other statistical metrics that help us understand the relationship between Malic acid and Alcohol content."
Logistic Regression,"Predict whether a sample has high OD280 based on Malic acid, Magnesium, and Total phenols.","```python

# Step 3: Check for missing values

# Step 7: Output the summary of the model
print(result.summary())
```","In this code, we first create a binary target variable `High_OD280` based on whether the OD280 value is above the mean. We then prepare our predictor variables, ensuring that there are no missing values. The predictor variables are converted to float, and a constant term is added to the model. We fit a logistic regression model using statsmodels and handle any potential errors during the fitting process. Finally, we print the summary of the model to evaluate the results."

We then categorized the continuous variable Flavanoidse into three groups (Low, Medium, High) to facilitate the comparison of means across these categories. Using the `statsmodels` library, we fitted an ANOVA model with OD280 as the dependent variable and the categorized Flavanoidse as the independent variable. Finally, we performed the ANOVA test and printed the results, which will indicate whether there are significant differences in the mean OD280 across the different levels of Flavanoidse."
