The `memory_agents` file defines a set of specialized agents designed to summarize and analyze memory and errors. These agents provide concise summaries of agent actions and errors in code, helping users understand and address issues efficiently.

### Classes

#### `memory_summarize_agent`

- **Purpose**: Summarizes the responses and actions of other agents along with the user query. It extracts key details to provide a clear and concise summary of what was done.

- **Inputs**:
  - `agent_response`: The output, commentary, and code from other agents.
  - `user_goal`: The user's query or intended goal.

- **Outputs**:
  - `summary`: A summary of the actions taken by the agent, formatted as follows:
    - **User Query**: Summarized user query with essential details.
    - **Agent**: Name of the agent.
    - **Stack_Used**: Python packages used.
    - **Actions**: Summary of the actions taken by the agent.

- **Usage Example**:
  ```python
  summary = memory_summarize_agent(
      agent_response="Agent visualized a line chart using plotly",
      user_goal="Visualize sales data trends"
  )
  # Outputs:
  # User Query: Visualize sales data trends
  # Agent: memory_summarize_agent
  # Stack_Used: plotly
  # Actions: Agent visualized a line chart using plotly
  ```

#### `error_memory_agent`

- **Purpose**: Provides a concise summary of errors in Python code and suggests corrections. This agent helps in understanding the nature of errors and how to fix them effectively.

- **Inputs**:
  - `incorrect_code`: The snippet of Python code that produced an error.
  - `error_metadata`: Metadata including the agent name, version, timestamp, user query, and correction details.
  - `correction`: The corrected code or solution provided.

- **Outputs**:
  - `summary`: A detailed description of the error and how to correct it, including:
    - **Error Summary**: A brief description of the error.
    - **Correction**: Explanation of how to correct the error.

- **Usage Example**:
  ```python
  summary = error_memory_agent(
      incorrect_code="list[10] = [1, 2, 3]",
      error_metadata="Agent Name: error_memory_agent, Agent Version: 1.0, Timestamp: 2024-08-10, User Query: Fix index error, Human-Defined Correction: List indexing issue",
      correction="IndexError occurred because the code attempted to access an index that does not exist. Ensure the index is within the bounds of the list."
  )
  # Outputs:
  # Error Summary: IndexError occurred because the code attempted to access an index that does not exist.
  # Correction: Ensure the index is within the bounds of the list. For example, use if index < len(my_list): to check the index before accessing the list element.
  ```

### Usage

- **`memory_summarize_agent`**: Use this agent to create summaries of the actions taken by various agents and to capture the essence of user queries and agent responses.

- **`error_memory_agent`**: Use this agent to analyze and summarize errors in Python code, providing corrections and detailed explanations to assist in debugging.

These agents facilitate efficient summarization and debugging by providing structured and informative outputs, which are crucial for maintaining and improving data analysis workflows.
