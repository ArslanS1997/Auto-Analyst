The `agents.py` file contains the definitions for various DSPy agents used in the Auto-Analyst system. Each agent is responsible for a specific aspect of data analysis or processing. The agents are implemented using DSPy signatures, which define their inputs and outputs.

### Agents

#### `analytical_planner`

- **Description**: The `analytical_planner` agent is responsible for routing queries to appropriate agents based on the user-defined goal, available datasets, and descriptions of available agents. It creates a comprehensive plan to achieve the goal by determining the sequence of agents to be used.

- **Inputs**:
  - `dataset`: The datasets available in the system. It should be used as a copy of the DataFrame.
  - `Agent_desc`: Descriptions of the agents available in the system.
  - `goal`: The user-defined goal that needs to be achieved.

- **Outputs**:
  - `plan`: A string representing the sequence of agents to be used (e.g., "Agent1->Agent2->Agent3").
  - `plan_desc`: A description of the reasoning behind the chosen plan, explaining why each agent was selected.

- **Purpose**: Develops a detailed plan for achieving the user-defined goal using the available agents and datasets. The output format includes a plan and an explanation for why each agent is included.

#### `goal_refiner_agent`

- **Description**: The `goal_refiner_agent` refines a user-defined goal to make it more detailed and actionable. It uses the available datasets and agent descriptions to enhance the goal, making it easier for the `analytical_planner` to create an effective plan.

- **Inputs**:
